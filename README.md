# Xojo-Tokenizer

Xojo module to convert a string into a series of tokens and, optionally, interpret them in stages.

## Overview

The concept is to create a series of classes that represent the tokens that might be found in the string and implement an event in each that will return the token after it.

## Installation

Open the Harness project and copy the M_Token module to your project.

**Important**: Do not drag the M_Token files directly from the folder into your project as it won't work right.

## Details
